# PROJECT-EDA-ON-STUDENT-DATASET
### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON STUDENT DATASET
## WHAT IS EDA:
Exploratory Data Analysis is a data analytic process that aims to understand the data in
depth and learn its different characterstics.
## STEPS INVOLVED IN EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
1.Understand the data : understanding the variables in the dataset,and on what kind of data
you are working with.
2.Clean the data : cleaning data from redundancy,irregularity and deleting unnecessary
columns,outliers which causes noise in the data.
3.Analysis of Relationship between variables : analysing the relationship between the
variables in the dataset.
4.Data visualisation : visualizing the relationship in different patterns to understand
easily.
## STUDENT DATASET:
This dataset tells about the students and this data is taken from kaggle website and we
will try to understand
the dataset by using pandas,numpy for data storing and processing and for visualisation
we use matplotlib and seaborn.
The data contains 6 coulmns:
1.Hours studied : no of hours studied by student.<br>
2.previous scores: The previous scores of student.<br>
3.extracircular activites: the student has extracircular activities or not.<br>
4.sleep hours: the no.of hours they are sleeping.<br>
5.sample question papers practiced: the no.of pervious questions papers they practiced.<br>
6.performance index : the performance of the student.<br>
